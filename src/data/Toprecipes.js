        instructions: "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.\r\n\r\nDefrost shrimp by putting in cold water, drain. Place the shrimp in serving dish (9x13 or 2 quart casserole) and toss gently with the olive oil, wine, 1 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Allow to sit at room temperature while you make the butter and garlic mixture.\r\n\r\nIn a small bowl, mash the softened butter with the garlic, shallots, parsley, rosemary, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, lemon juice, egg yolk, panko, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper until combined.\r\n\r\nSpread the butter mixture evenly over the shrimp. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until hot and bubbly. If you like the top browned, place under a broiler for 1-3 minutes (keep an eye on it). Serve with lemon wedges and French bread.\r\n\r\nNote: if using fresh shrimp, arrange for presentation. Starting from the outer edge of a 14-inch oval gratin dish, arrange the shrimp in a single layer cut side down with the tails curling up and towards the center of the dish. Pour the remaining marinade over the shrimp. ",

        instructions: "Cook the rice, if it is not already.\r\n\r\nWhen you have all your ingredients prepped, arrange them within arm's reach of the stove. Heat a small splash of sesame oil in a wok or large nonstick pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the tofu and cook for a couple of minutes, until the tofu is golden. Remove from the pan. (You can also cook the tofu in a dry nonstick or well seasoned pan.)\r\n\r\nAdd another splash of oil to the wok and, as soon as it's hot, add the asparagus and stir for 2 minutes.  Add the white part of the green onions and chiles, and stir for another 2 minutes.  Add the green part of the green onions, and stir for another 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and ginger, and stir for 30 seconds, then add the cashews and spinach and stir for another minute, or until the spinach wilts and collapses. \r\n\r\nReturn the tofu to the pan. Stir in the stir-fry sauce. Cook for another minute, stirring constantly.\r\n\r\nRemove from heat and stir in the mint and basil. Season with enough soy sauce to make the flavors pop, starting with a splash.\r\n\r\nServe over cooked rice.\r\n\r\nNutrition information does not include stir-fry sauce.",
